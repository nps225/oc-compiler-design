FOR STUDENTS WORKING ALONE, OR FOR THE SUBMITTING PARTNER:

1. Copy all files from ../.score into student's directory.

2. Run mk.build and mk.tests, then determine which project
   the student has submitted.

   if      *.oil files generated - grade according to SCORE.asg5
   else if *.sym files generated - grade according to SCORE.asg4
   else if *.ast files generated - grade according to SCORE.asg3
   else if *.tok files generated - grade according to SCORE.asg2
   else    *.str files generated - grade according to SCORE.asg1

   DELETE SCORE.asg? files that are not relevant to the grading.
   Only one SCORE.asg? file should be present when grading.

3. If mk.build failed, look at the code to determine what 
   modules have been attempted, and grade the SOURCE CODE
   section with the appropriate SCORE.asg? file.
   In that case, assign 0 to PROGRAM TESTING.

4. If pair programming, grade according to SCORE.pair and
   deduct points from that file and enter into the SCORE.asg?
   that remains.

5. ln -s SCORE.asg? -> SCORE
   That is the SCORE.asg file that remains should be a local
   symlink to SCORE (not an absolute symlink).

FOR PARTNERS:

Grade only one partner of the pair.
For the non-submitting partner, make TWO symlinks:
   SCORE.asg? -> ../(partner)/SCORE.asg?
   SOCRE -> ../(partner)/SCORE

AFTER GRADING:

cd asg3
ls -la | wc -l
ls -la */SCORE.asg? | wc -l
ls -la */SCORE | wc -l
should all show the same number of lines.
